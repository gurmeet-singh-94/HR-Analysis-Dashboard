### -->> INSIGHTS:
#### . 237 employees out of 1470 have left the organization.
#### . Majority (116) of employees leaving are aged 26-35, followed by 18-25 (44 employees).This suggests that early-career employees are the most likely to leave
#### . The highest attrition is from Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) backgrounds. These are critical fields where retaining talent is essential.
#### . 150 males left vs. 87 females, indicating that men are leaving at a higher rate.
#### . Laboratory Technicians (62), Sales Executives (57), and Research Scientists (47) experience the most attrition.These roles might have higher workload, stress, or better external opportunities.
#### . Most attrition occurs within the first 2 years, peaking at year 1.Long-term employees (10+ years) have much lower attrition rates.
#### . 163 employees who left had salaries up to 5K, showing a strong correlation between low salary and attrition.As salary increases, attrition reduces significantly.


### -->> CONCLUSIONS:
